File READ_ME.txt in folder projects\03_auxFiles

The file RTS.java is a run time system for the alg compilers
in projects alg30, alg31, alg32, ...

The scripts a-0.cmd to a-2.cmd
   generate a language processor from a gentle source file.
The scripts b-0.cmd to b-3.cmd
   run a previously generated language processor and
   carry out some further steps required in certain projects.
The scripts clean-0 and clean-1
   delete all files and folders generated by the Gentle compiler
   and its allies.

RECOMMENDATION: Write your own scripts for your projects.
As an alternative you can copy an a-n, a b-n and a clean-n
script from this folder into your project folder and rename them
(e.g. to a.cmd, b.cmd and clean.cmd or whatever fits your taste).
For each predefined project folder the following scripts are recommended:

alg10        a-1 b-1 clean-0
alg20        a-1 b-1 clean-0

alg30        a-2 b-3 clean-1
alg31        a-2 b-3 clean-1
alg32        a-2 b-3 clean-1
alg33        a-2 b-3 clean-1
